# matsim-example-project

A small example of how to use MATSim as a library for the DMV area.

By default, this project uses the latest (pre-)release. In order to use a different version, edit `pom.xml`.

* all required input files are in `scenarios.dmv` folder
* run `org.matsim.project.RunMatsim_dmv` 
* the output files will reside in `output` folder
  
  
### Import into eclipse

1. download a modern version of eclipse. This should have maven and git included by default.
1. `file->import->git->projects from git->clone URI` and clone as specified above.  _It will go through a 
sequence of windows; it is important that you import as 'general project'._
1. `file->import->maven->existing maven projects`

Sometimes, step 3 does not work, in particular after previously failed attempts.  Sometimes, it is possible to
right-click to `configure->convert to maven project`.  If that fails, the best thing seems to remove all 
pieces of the failed attempt in the directory and start over.

### Import into IntelliJ

`File -> New -> Project from Version Control` paste the repository url and hit 'clone'. IntelliJ usually figures out
that the project is a maven project. If not: `Right click on pom.xml -> import as maven project`.

### Java Version

The project uses Java 11. Usually a suitable SDK is packaged within IntelliJ or Eclipse. Otherwise, one must install a 
suitable sdk manually, which is available [here](https://openjdk.java.net/)

### Building and Running it locally

You can build an executable jar-file by executing the following command:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

or on Windows:

```sh
mvnw.cmd clean package
```
